Perceptual hashing, also known as fingerprint hashing, is a method for generating a unique representation of data, such as images, audio, or videos, that enables quick comparison and identification between the data. The main goal of perceptual hashing is to create a stable and uniform representation even in the presence of minor changes in the original data.

Perceptual hashing leverages the characteristics and patterns present in the data, which can be detected by humans with visual or auditory perception. This method summarizes the data into a series of numbers or bits that represent the important features of the data. The resulting hash can be used to rapidly compare data, identifying similarities or differences among the available data.

In the context of images, perceptual hashing can be used to find visual similarities between images, such as determining whether two images are identical copies or have high visual similarity. In the context of audio, perceptual hashing can be employed to detect similarities or differences between two audio recordings. In the case of videos, perceptual hashing can help identify similarities between video clips or search for video duplicates.

One popular example of perceptual hashing is the pHash algorithm. pHash generates a hashing representation based on the Fourier transformation of an image. This algorithm is robust against minor changes in the image, such as shifts, rotations, or resizing, thereby providing consistent results for similar images.

Perceptual hashing finds various practical applications, including plagiarism detection, duplicate identification, content-based image retrieval, and more.
